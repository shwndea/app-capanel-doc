Features
================================================================

Overview
--------

This section documents the features in the California Accountability Panel application,
organized as Features (F1-F8) and following Agile-ish development methodology.
Each Feature represents a major user-facing capability built to address specific stakeholder
needs in K-12 educational accountability and data transparency.

Our feature architecture follows industry best practices in software engineering:

- **Component-Based Design**: Reusable UI components with clear separation of concerns
- **Data-Driven Development**: Features directly map to California Department of Education (CDE) accountability metrics
- **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensures equitable access for all users
- **Privacy by Design**: FERPA-compliant data suppression rules protect student identities

Architecture Principles
-----------------------

**1. Separation of Concerns**

Each Feature (F1-F8) is further implemented using components. This two-tier hierarchy ensures:

- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't cascade across the system
- **Testability**: Each layer can be unit tested independently
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without refactoring existing code
- **Reusability**: Components are shared across multiple features

**2. Domain-Driven Design**

Features map directly to educational accountability domains:

- Academic Performance (English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science)
- Student Support (English Learner Progress, Chronic Absenteeism)
- School Climate (Suspension Rates)
- College & Career Readiness (Graduation Rates, A-G Completion)

This alignment ensures the codebase mirrors the mental model of our primary users: educators, administrators, and policymakers.

**3. Progressive Enhancement**

Features are built with a "progressive enhancement" approach:

- **Base Layer**: Semantic HTML providing core functionality
- **Enhancement Layer**: CSS for visual presentation and responsive design  
- **Interaction Layer**: JavaScript for dynamic features (sorting, filtering, trend charts)

This ensures accessibility for users with varying device capabilities and assistive technologies.

Educational Value for K-12 Computer Science Curriculum
-------------------------------------------------------

This project serves as an excellent real-world case study for teaching computer science concepts to K-12 students:

**For Middle School (Grades 6-8):**

- **Data Structures**: Understanding how student performance data flows from CSV files to visual displays
- **Algorithms**: Introduction to sorting algorithms through interactive data tables
- **User Interface Design**: Principles of accessible, inclusive design for diverse users
- **Computational Thinking**: Breaking down complex problems (educational equity) into manageable features

**For High School (Grades 9-12):**

- **Software Architecture**: Component-based design patterns and modular programming
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React framework, FastAPI backend
- **Data Privacy & Ethics**: FERPA compliance, data suppression rules, ethical considerations in displaying student data
- **Version Control**: Git workflow, documentation-as-code, collaborative development
- **API Design**: RESTful principles, data ingestion from California Department of Education APIs
- **Database Design**: SQL schema design for storing accountability metrics
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, accessibility testing with WCAG standards

**Cross-Curricular Connections:**

- **Social Studies**: California education policy (LCFF, LCAP, Dashboard accountability)
- **Mathematics**: Statistical analysis, percentiles, year-over-year change calculations
- **Civics**: Public data transparency, parent/guardian participation in school improvement
- **Ethics**: Balancing transparency with student privacy protection

Learning Pathways
------------------

Students can engage with this codebase at multiple skill levels:

**Beginner (No Prior Coding Experience):**

1. Explore the deployed application interface
2. Analyze how color-coded indicators communicate performance levels
3. Identify user personas and their information needs
4. Create wireframes for new features using design tools

**Intermediate (Some HTML/CSS/JavaScript):**

1. Fork the repository and set up local development environment
2. Modify CSS styles to improve visual hierarchy
3. Add new accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
4. Write documentation for existing components

**Advanced (Full-Stack Development):**

1. Implement new performance metrics (e.g., ELPAC proficiency levels)
2. Build data visualization components using D3.js or Chart.js
3. Create API endpoints for custom data queries
4. Design and implement database migrations for new accountability measures
5. Write comprehensive test suites with high code coverage

Technical Stack (Learning Opportunities)

Design Patterns Implemented
----------------------------

This project demonstrates several important software design patterns:

**Structural Patterns:**

- **Composite Pattern**: Nested component hierarchy (Feature → Component)
- **Decorator Pattern**: Higher-order components for accessibility features
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified API interfaces for complex CDE data structures

**Behavioral Patterns:**

- **Observer Pattern**: React state management and re-rendering on data changes
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable algorithms for different metric calculations
- **Template Method**: Reusable component templates with customizable behavior

**Architectural Patterns:**

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separation of data, presentation, and business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling through FastAPI's dependency system
